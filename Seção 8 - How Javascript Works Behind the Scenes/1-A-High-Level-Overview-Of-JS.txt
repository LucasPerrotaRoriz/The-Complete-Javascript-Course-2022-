High level - There are low level languages like c, where developers must manage the resources
manually. Javascript as a high level language does not need to manage resources manually 
this happens automatically. 

Garbage collection - It's an algorithm inside the js engine that removes automatically unused objects
from the computer memory.

Javascript is an interpreted or just-in-time-compiled language

Multi-paradigm - A paradigm is a way to structure the code. Some examples are: 
Procedural programming - which is basically a code that follows a linear way in terms 
of it's structure with function in between.
Object-oriented programming (OOP)
Functional programming (FP)

Prototype-based object-oriented - Almost everything in JS is a object, except for primitive values.
Arrays are for example objects. Arrays are created from a array blueprint called prototype, the prototype 
has all the methods, and this methods are inherited by an array when it's created. This is a oversimplification.

First class functions - Functions are treated exactly like variables. Functions can be passed to functions and 
also returned from functions. This allows for functional programming.

Dynamic - Types are defined dynamically.

Single-threaded - Concurrency model is how JS handles multiple tasks happening at the same time.
JS runs in a single thread meaning it can only do one thing at a time.

Non-blocking event loop - The event loop takes long running task, runs them in the background, and 
once they are finished puts them in the main thread.
